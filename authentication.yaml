Token: MTA3NDg0OTMzNDU0NzQ1NjEzMg.G4d5s4.lkHffMw1Wv6Q2g51XOKUiO3VerM0UW7fVx9ZhU

Introduction: If you don't know where to get your bot tokens, go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
  Create an application > Bot > Add Bot > Reveal Token

  To invite your bot to a server, OAuth2 > tick Bot > Select the permissions you want > Then copy the invite link in the middle

  You want to put your bot token in another separate file like this and import them over to the main script so you can
  exclude all sensitive information if you are ever going to upload them on GitHub by adding this script to a .gitignore file.
